# Twitter-APP-Social-Mining

## Project Overview
The Twitter App social-Mining is a tool to perform queries to Twitter and retrieve useful information with 4 different kinds of visualizations. The 4 main functions of this app are:
1. Wordcloud
2. Dynamic table
3. Sentiment Analysis
4. Topic Modeling

## APP
You may find the application online on: 
Notice that the online version might crash when using some functions such as Topic Modeling, so you should try the off-line version instead.

## Install off-line version
1. The app is built on top of R so the first step is to install the more recent version:[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)
2. Install all the packages: 
`install.packages("tidytext")` 
Some packages may require to install through github: ` library(devtools) install_github('')`
